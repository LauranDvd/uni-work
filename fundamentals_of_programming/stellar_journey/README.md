# Stellar Journey game
I used **OOP** to make a **layered architecture** game involving aircrafts. The player has to destroy the three enemy ships without crashing into them.
Commands:
* **warp C3**: move your ship to cell C3
* **fire C3**: fire at cell C3 (needs to be next to the ship)
* **cheat**

Every time an enemy ship is destroyed, the others reposition.  
The program protects itself against any possible invalid input.
