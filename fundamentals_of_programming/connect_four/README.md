# Connect Four game
I used *OOP* to make a *layered architecture* implementation of [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four). The player needs to connect four of his 
pieces before the computer. The computer wins and blocks wins in one move whenever possible. 
Many functions have **PyUnit test cases**. The program protects itself against any possible invalid input.
